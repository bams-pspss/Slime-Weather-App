## ðŸš€ About the Project
**Slimy Weather App** is a fun and simple Node.js + Expres web app that fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap and displays it with a cute SLIME-THEMED graphics (inspired by most of the anime I watch recently ðŸ˜Ž). <br>
This project is a personal creation where I took what I learned in college and turned it into a real-world application â€” combining practical coding with a touch of creativity!

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the App
I want place to express my new skill on **ASPRITE**, drawing is one of my big side quest that I want to master! In order to make application colorful and fun for boring app!
I think weather application with slime reaction is COOOL! This application will update more with background that match with the weather, but for now **PLEASE ENJOY MY LITTLE SLIME!**
